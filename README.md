# 🫁 Real-Time Lung Cancer Prediction using Lazy Learning (KNN)

This project aims to predict lung cancer risk using a lazy learning approach — specifically the **k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** algorithm — based on patient symptoms and health data. It was developed as part of an academic course and also deployed in a real-world setting.

## 📄 Project Overview

Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers worldwide. Early detection significantly increases the chances of successful treatment. This project applies a simple yet effective KNN classifier for real-time prediction of lung cancer using clinical and symptom-based features.

### 🔍 Key Goals:
- Enable early detection of lung cancer
- Provide a real-time, non-invasive prediction tool
- Assist doctors in risk assessment and personalized care

## 🧠 Algorithm Used
- ✅ **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- Hyperparameter tuning performed to find the optimal `k`
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

## 📊 Dataset
- Custom dataset collected via:
  - Community field survey
  - Patient symptom records
  - IoMT (Internet of Medical Things) sensor inputs
- Includes features such as:
  - Age, smoking history, family history
  - Cough frequency, chest pain, fatigue, breathlessness

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Google Colab (Python)
- scikit-learn
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib

## 📦 Files Included
- `lung_cancer_prediction.ipynb` — Google Colab notebook (source code)
- `Real_Time_Lung_Cancer_Report.pdf` — Detailed project report (PDF)

## 🏥 Deployment
- ✅ Delivered to **Sri Srinivasa Hospital**, Hyderabad
- ✅ Received feedback from medical professionals
- ✅ Incorporated explainable AI features using SHAP for interpretability
